###Bias Examples
**Confirmation Bias**  
*Description:* Tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs.
    
*Example:* When doing research about a subject, we tend to phrase our searches based on existing beliefs, choose sources that confirm our beliefs and interpret what we read according to this as well. The way we remember things is also influenced by confirmation bias.  

**Clustering Illusion**  
*Description:* Tendency to overestimate the importance of small runs, streaks, or clusters in large samples of random data (that is, seeing phantom patterns).  

*Example:* When analysing bugs (amount, type, where they occur) you seem to notice a pattern. Is it truly a pattern?

**Illusion of control**  
*Description:* The tendency to overestimate one's degree of influence over other external events.

*Example:* Creating a project plan for a software project with detailed estimated tasks.

**Sunk cost fallacy**  
*Description:* Previous investments affects decision making so that the decisions become irrational.

*Example:* When evaluating options, the time and money already invested in a product, makes us less willing to let go of that product and choose a better option.

**Automation bias**  
*Description:* The tendency to depend excessively on automated systems which can lead to erroneous automated information overriding correct decisions.

*Example:* Results from automated tests are viewed as more important than they are.

**Inattentional blindness**   
*Description:* Inability to perceive obvious events due to concentrating and focus on a specific thing.

*Example:* Seeing a magic trick, trying to concentrate on what the magician is doing makes us blind to things happening in the surrounding environment.

**Hindsight bias**  
*Description:* The inclination to see past events as being more predictable than they actually were; it’s also called the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect.

*Example:* Seeing a software project in retrospect, evaluating decisions without the context they were made in

**Availability heuristic**  
*Description:* A mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision.

*Example:* In testing: when you are asked to test something, are you choosing the same techniques and tools over and over again? Maybe it is because they come to mind easily…

**Anchoring Effect**  
*Description:* Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias for an individual to rely too heavily on an initial piece of information offered (known as the "anchor") when making decisions.

*Example:* 1. When a website looks beautiful, you assume the overall quality is good. 2. When a developer delivers good code you tend to test more superficially. 3. When a developer usually delivers crappy code, you tend to test more thoroughly
