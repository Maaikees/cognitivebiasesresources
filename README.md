# cognitive biases resources
Welcome!

Thank you for showing up. You are viewing this most likely because you’ve attend my talk “Mapping Biases to Testing” or the workshop "Mindbusters - Test Your Mind" with my friend Göran Kero. Or someone referred you to this repository. In any case: great!

In this repository you can find an [assortment of resources](/resources.md) if you want to learn more about cognitive biases and what role they can play in software development, so you don’t have to find the good stuff yourself.

Please create a pull request if you have something to add, thanks!
