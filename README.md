# cognitive biases resources
Welcome!

Thank you for showing up. You are viewing this most likely because you’ve attend my talk “Mapping Biases to Testing”. Or someone referred you to it. In any case: great!

In this repository you can find an [assortment of resources](/README.md) if you want to learn more about cognitive biases and what role they can play in software development, so you don’t have to find the good stuff yourself.

Please create a pull request if you have something to add, thanks!
